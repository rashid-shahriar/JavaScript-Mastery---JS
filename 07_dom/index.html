<p>Finding HTML elements by id - The Easiest and the most efficient way to find an element id by id. We can assign some id to an element and can select that element as shown below. <br><br>
    Finding HTML elements by tag name - consider that for some reasons we want to manipulate all elements of a particular kind . Let's say we want to manipulate all images of our webpage which can be done as shown below. <br><br>
    Finding HTML elements by class name - Class names are assigned to elements to style them uniquely. lets say to style all links in out website we had assigned some class say "our-link" to them and now we want to manipulate them. <br><br>
    Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors - css selectors are that you can use any combination of class, id, tag name and many more to select a particular element. we will not go into detail as it itself can be an another topic. For example lets just say that we had given a same class "link" to all our links in web page as well as some span elements also to make them look like a link but now we just want to select all the span elements and not the links.
